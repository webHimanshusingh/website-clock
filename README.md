1 HTML:<br>
The HTML file (index.html) sets up the basic structure of the webpage.<br>
It includes a div element with the ID clock inside a container div for displaying the clock.<br>
It links to the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for the clock functionality.<br>
2 CSS:<br>
The CSS file (styles.css) styles the body to center the clock on the page and gives it a dark background.<br>
The clock-container class styles the container holding the clock, adding padding, a border, and a background color.<br>
The hashtag#clock ID styles the clock text, setting the font size and color.<br>
3 JavaScript:<br>
The JavaScript file (script.js) defines the updateClock function, which updates the clock every second.<br>
updateClock retrieves the current time, formats the hours, minutes, and seconds to always have two digits (using padStart), and sets the text content of the clock element.<br>
setInterval (updateClock, 1000) calls updateClock every second to keep the clock updated.<br>
updateClock() is called once initially to display the time immediately upon loading the page.<br>
By copying these code snippets into their respective files, you can create a fully functional digital clock. Open index.html in a web browser to see the clock in action.<br>
